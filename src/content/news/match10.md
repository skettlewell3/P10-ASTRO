Arsenal drew 1-1 with Manchester City in dramatic fashion. City struck early via a Haaland header, exploiting Arsenal’s defensive momentary lapse. For long stretches, City looked likely to kill the game, dictating tempo and pressing. But in stoppage time, Gabriel Martinelli produced a moment of magic — an audacious lob from the edge of the area — to snatch a draw for the Gunners.

City were polished, dominant for most of the match, and looked in control. Arsenal were pragmatic, disciplined, and displayed fight until the end. Martinelli’s equaliser made the difference.
