Newcastle visited Bournemouth and left with a point after a 0-0 stalemate. Chances were sparse. Bournemouth nearly broke through at times but were thwarted by well-organized defence. Newcastle were cautious, prioritising solidity and attempting to nick something late via counters, but couldn’t find the decisive moment.

Neither side deserved too much flak — conditions, pressure, and disciplined backlines kept things tight. Frustrating for attackers, but a clean sheet for both.
