Liverpool came away with a 2-1 win over Everton in a derby that rarely let up. Gravenberch struck early to give the Reds the opening goal, and Ekitike doubled the advantage before halftime. Everton rallied in the second half, with Gueye netting a well-taken strike to set up a tense finish. Liverpool defended resolutely, absorbing pressure and denying any late equaliser chances.

Both sides showed intensity, but Liverpool’s sharper transitions and better composure under pressure proved decisive. Everton’s substitutions added urgency but lacked cohesion. In the end, Everton’s fightback was too little, too late.
