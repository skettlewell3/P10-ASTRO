Brighton and Tottenham played out a thrilling 2-2 draw, with lead changes, late chances, and moments of magic. Tottenham grabbed an early lead through slick attacking play, only for Brighton to respond before half-time. The second half saw both teams push for winners — Tottenham struck again, but Brighton refused to lie down and equalised late on.

Tottenham looked comfortable at times, but lacked depth in defence late. Brighton’s home support lifted them, and their persistence earned a deserved point. Could’ve gone either way.
