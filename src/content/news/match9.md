Leeds left Molineux with a deserved 3-1 victory over Wolves. From the off Leeds moved the ball quicker and punished Wolves' lapses in midfield. Wolves grabbed an early opener and looked to swing momentum, but Leeds hit back before half-time with a composed equaliser. The visitors then took control in the second half, scoring twice — one from a swift counter and another from a well-worked set piece — to seal the result.

Wolves offered scraps and looked blunt in attack; defensive naivety cost them, and the home crowd left annoyed. Leeds were sharper, hungrier, and far more clinical.
