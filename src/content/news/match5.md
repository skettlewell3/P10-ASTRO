Crystal Palace emerged victorious 2-1 at West Ham in a match that swung back and forth. West Ham struck early, capitalising on space in midfield. Palace then asserted themselves, equalising through a composed build up play. In the dying stages, Palace broke through on the counter to seal the match.

West Ham dominated for stretches, but grew sloppy in transition. Palace stayed disciplined, hit their moments, and didnâ€™t panic. That resilience won them the day.
