Manchester United edged Chelsea 2-1 in a gritty encounter. United opened the scoring with a header off a set piece. Chelsea responded before the break with a well-worked goal, but United retook the lead in the second half through a composed finish. Chelsea pressed for an equaliser in the final 20 minutes, but United held firm.

Chelsea showed flashes of attacking intent, but lacked killer final passes in the decisive moments. Unitedâ€™s defence held steady under pressure. A narrow win, but one that gives United momentum.
