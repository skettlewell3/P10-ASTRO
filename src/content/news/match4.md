Fulham put on a strong display to defeat Brentford 3-1 at home. After a cagey opening, Fulham broke through just before half time. Brentford equalised early in the second half, but Fulham responded with two quick goals to kill off the game. From then on they controlled possession and limited Brentford’s threats.

Brentford looked dangerous on the break, but were vulnerable to Fulham’s pressing. Fulham’s front line was direct and clinical. A good day for Silva’s side.
