Burnley and Nottingham Forest shared spoils in a 1-1 draw. Burnley struck first after sustained pressure, but Forest responded shortly after the interval with a neat finish. After that, the match settled into scrappy spells, with both teams chasing control but struggling to break through.

Burnley defended stoutly for large parts but lacked invention in attack. Forest were compact, disciplined, and dangerous when countering. A fair outcome from a tight contest.
