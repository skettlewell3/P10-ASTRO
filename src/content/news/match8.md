Sunderland and Aston Villa played out a 1-1 draw punctuated by late drama. Villa went ahead through a long-range effort just before half time. Sunderland hit back after Villa were reduced to ten men, with an equaliser midway through the second half. The rest of the game saw end-to-end exchanges, but neither side could find a winner.

Villa looked shaky after the red card, and Sunderland’s persistence paid dividends. Villa’s resilience kept them in it, but they’ll rue not holding on.
